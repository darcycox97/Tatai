1. Finish lay out of each scene (using scenebuilder - different fxml file for each screen)
	- Home Screen
	- Game Screen 
2. Implement a separate controller for each fxml file.
3. Write CSS and link it to the fxml.

How game mode works:
- Generate 10 random numbers from either 1-9 or 1-99 depending on what button was clicked.
- For each number:
	- Press record, which activates HTK
	- Scan HTK output for the correct number (need a way of determining 
	  how to spell each number to check if the string is the same).
	- Display if the user was correct or incorrect.
	- If correct, move on to the next number, add 1 to the score/10
	- If not, give them a second chance and record if they were correct or not.
- After all numbers have been shown, show them the final score.
