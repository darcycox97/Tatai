# Tatai
<p> Tatai is the result of a Software Engineering design project </p>

<p> It is targeted towards children in a classroom environment, and aims to support their learning of basic math. 
Tatai consists of a gameplay module, where users are presented with math equations and must speak the answer in Maori. 
Also included is a statistics module allowing users to track their personal progress.</p>

<p> Tatai has been designed to run on linux, with ffmpeg installed as well as the HTK voice recognition toolkit. It will still 
run without these requirements, but the voice recognition will not work correctly. </p>
